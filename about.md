My PhD has been mostly about approaches integrating machine learning with systems neuroscience, from data acquisition to analysis and model building. See my projects [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=Dj9FIoIAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate). My work has been recognized by a Goldwater Scholarship (2014) and an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship (2016-2021), and I was a finalist for the Hertz Fellowship (2015).
